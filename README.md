# Hey there, I'm Ian Merrill

## About Me

I am a full stack engineer with extensive experience working for various startups and large companies. My expertise includes web development and mobile development with React Native. I have a strong background in TypeScript, React, and GraphQL with Node.js backends. Additionally, I have experience in Phoenix/Elixir and am eager to continue my growth in Elixir due to its long-term potential. Recently, I have been exploring the integration of open-source LLMs into my development environment using Ollama and the Continue extension for VS Code to run them locally on my GPU so that I don't need to worry about any code being shared over an API integration to another service. I believe programmers will need to incorporate these new tools into their workflow to be as productive and competitive as possible.
